A short 'R' example script that plots Hurricane SANDY data on a slice of the US.

NOTE: This now uses the CONE KML file from the [NHC] (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/archive_forecast_results.php?id=al18&year=2012&name=Hurricane%20SANDY) but is not perfect as it (a) doesn't have the 3-day cone and (b) does not line up with the track. I'll be fixing both of these issues, but not for a couple of daysâ€¦
